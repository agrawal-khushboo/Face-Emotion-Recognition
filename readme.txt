The project can be used to perform logistic regression to classify two emotions and softmax regression to classify multiple emotions. 

The project is implemented in Python 3. 
To implement this follow the steps mentioned below:

1. The image files should be stored in the local directory and specify the path as mentioned in the code.
2. The code consist of following sections mentioned below and can be implemented individually. 
	- Principle Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction
	- Logistic Regression using gradient descent 
	- Softmax Regression using gradient descent
	- Softmax regression using stochastic descent 
	
The code file contains suitable comments to understand the flow.
